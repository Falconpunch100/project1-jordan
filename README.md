Blake: I added our second API as well as the keys for our API calls. I have the secondary api as a geolocation so on the webpage load it gathers your data and stores it in an object. Once in that object it then makes another API call to openweather map API and pulls the current temp, as well as high, low and what it feels like (temp). On our first API we have that API running twice, once for the search of the food you want, the second to find the URL of the actual recipe.
